## Contributing

Editors like Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator tower over Mondrian in their features and abilities. While a big goal in Mondrian is to avoid feature creep
and keep it visually bare, it's definitely still missing a lot. Contributors are encouraged to develop new tools and utilities they feel are missing
as well as optimizing the performance of those that already exist. All significant contributions will get credit in the meta window within the app.
